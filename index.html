                The kickoff went fantastic, thank you so much for 
                everyone who braved the freezing weather to come!
                The notable details to know is that our next meeting will
                discuss the upcoming career fairs, and our first speaker series
                is this month from a senior software developer at Discord,
                Hitesh Sarabu!

            <h1>Project Overhaul</h1>
            <p>
                We have overhauled projects from last semester, and hope to do even
                more with them before our first meeting 2/13! We are actively looking
                for input, which you can give by emailing one of the VP of Engineering 
                (segedi@wisc.edu, or jsangha@wisc.edu),
                or filling out the appropriate section of the google form on the project 
                GitHub that is released Friday 2/4.

            <p>
                You are looking at it! This is our brand new website that
                has all the information you need for the club.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site has been made using nothing but plain html, css,
                and javascript. No special libraries needed! GitHub hosts it free
                of charge provided we don't use it commercially. The source code if
                you want to check it out can be found <a href="https://github.com/segedi-UW/SDC-Site">here!</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are thinking to yourself that this is something you want to
                learn about, keep that in mind for Workshop polls!
