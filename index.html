                    We have overhauled projects from last semester, and hope to do even
                    more with them before our first meeting <s>2/13</s> 2/20! We are actively looking
                    for input, which you can give by emailing one of the VP of Engineering
                    (segedi@wisc.edu, or jsangha@wisc.edu),
                    or filling out the appropriate section of the google form on the project
                    GitHub that is released Friday 2/4.
