            <p>
                Our goal is simple - we aim to improve the practical 
                software development skills of our members. 
                To do this, we ask experienced developers who are 
                in the field to come talk to our members; we provide
                workshops that teach skills that may not be taught in
                the classroom; and we provide an environment for our
                members to collaborate with their peers on projects that 
                are essential to their development.
            </p>
