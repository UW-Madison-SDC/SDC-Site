        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            To get going on projects the first thing you
            should do is read the project <a href="https://github.com/segedi-UW/SDC-Projects">GitHub repository</a>.
            This same link can be found in the top right of any page on our site as well.
            <br/><br/>
            On that page is information on everything you need to be successful with projects this semester.
            It also contains a link to the google form that 
            <strong>is due Saturday, 2/12</strong>. Teams will
            be assigned on 2/13 before the first project meeting. Responses that come in after this date
            will be ignored unless you reach out to one of the VP of Engineering (segedi@wisc.edu).

    <div id="purpose" class="section">
        <h1>Purpose of Projects</h1>
        <p>
            Projects are a chance to engage with your peers, learn how to work in a team, experience 
            taking on responsibility and leadership, and work on your development skills. This makes 
            these projects a fantastic oppurtunity for growth; however, they only provide as much as we 
            put into them.

            This semester we want to showcase your projects! If you want to be included on this 
            page early then contact the VP of Engineering (segedi@wisc.edu). If you have a project
            that is continuing from a previous semester you should reach out!
            <br><br>
            Showcasing projects is great for inspiring and motivating projects, and also a
            congratulations to those involved in the project for all their hard work. Projects on this 
            site will have names of members and a description of the project (provided by the team).
